        <h2>About this Agreement</h2>

        <p>
          The Wanderer.ai source code is publicly available but this is not free software.
          To use Wanderer.ai products on a public server or inside your Apps, you need to purchase a license.
          This End User License Agreement (the "Agreement") is fundamental to the relationship between you and us.
          Therefore we recommend to read this Agreement carefully before you download, install or use Wanderer.ai.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not download, install or use Wanderer.ai.
          Installation or use of Wanderer.ai signifies that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Domain</h3>
        <p>
          A domain is a name registered inside the Domain Name System (DNS). Any kind of a subdomain acts as a separate domain for this agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>Public Website</h3>
        <p>
          A public website (Including Progessive Web Apps) is a website that is reachable through the public internet and hosted on a single domain.
        </p>

        <h3>Public App</h3>
        <p>
          A public App is any kind of an application that can be run on a computer device (e.g. Computer, PC, Smartphone, Tablet, Smartwatch, ...)
          and that is accessible to the general public. That includes not only classical smartphone Apps but also digital signage computer systems too.
        </p>

        <h3>Development machine</h3>
        <p>
          A development environment or development machine can only be used by a few people and is not publicly visible.
        </p>

        <h3>Wanderer.ai Chat</h3>
        <p>
          The chat only includes the chat component, which can be integrated on websites. The chat is essentially defined by this package: https://github.com/wanderer-ai/wanderer/tree/master/packages/wanderer-chat-browser
        </p>

        <h3>Wanderer.ai Builder</h3>
        <p>
          The builder is the software that can be used to build chatbot flows. This is essentially defined by this package: https://github.com/wanderer-ai/wanderer/tree/master/packages/wanderer-builder-browser
        </p>

        <h2>Usage for a public website or public App</h2>
        <p>
          Installing Wanderer.ai on a public domain or inside an App requires a paid license.
          As Wanderer.ai is software and software is intangible, we don't sell it as such.
          Instead, this Agreement grants a license for each purchase to install and use one or multiple instances of Wanderer.ai on a specific Website or inside an App.
          Additional Wanderer.ai licenses must be purchased in order to install and use Wanderer.ai on additional Websites or inside additional Apps.
        </p>

        <p>
          The license is non-exclusive (meaning that You are not the only one who We will issue a license) and generally non-transferable
          (meaning that the one who purchases the license is the licensee).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you need to transfer your Wanderer.ai license to another individual or company, please get in touch directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          A license is valid for all Updates of the same major Wanderer.ai release. We reserve the right to charge an upgrade fee for Upgrade releases.
        </p>

        <h2>Order process</h2>
        <p>
          The ordering process is completely handled by our partner Paddle.
        </p>

        <h2>Free licenses</h2>
        <p>
          Wanderer.ai can be used for free in the following cases:
        </p>

        <h3>Use it directly from the Wanderer.ai Domain</h3>
        <p>
          You can use Wanderer.ai completely for free by using the Software directly from the Wanderer.ai domain. So you can use the chat and the builder for free.
          Attention! This is only valid if the Wanderer.ai domain is used directly! If you want to integrate Wanderer.ai through frames, iframes or via CDN, you need a paid license.
        </p>

        <h3>Usage on a development machine</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that it should be possible to test and evaluate software before having to purchase a license.
          Also, we understand that a web project first needs to be built in a protected environment before it can be published.
          Therefore, installing and using Wanderer.ai on a development machine is free for as long as you need.
          This includes permanent usage of Wanderer.ai in an not public intranet.
        </p>
