          This is commercial software.
          That means that you have to purchase a license if you plan to run the botbuilder or single chatbots on your own website
          Use the botbuilder and the chatbots for free as long as you use them with the Wanderer.ai domain.
          But the detailed terms are not very clear right now.

          Also the pricing model is not very clear right now.
          But I want to keep it simple. So you have to purchase a license code for each domain on which a bot is running.
